<h2>Tips for Poster Preparation </h2>

<p>Posters should stimulate discussion, not give a long presentation. Therefore, keep text to a minimum, emphasize graphics, and make sure every item
included in your poster is necessary. </p>

<ul>
<li> Utilize handouts to supplement your poster. </li>
<li> Goal: 20% text, 40% graphics, 40% space. </li>
<li> Make sure ideas flow logically from one section to the next. </li>
<li> Use charts and graphs to illustrate data (avoid large tables of raw data). </li>
<li>  Use high resolution photographs (web images often will not work). </li>
<li> Do not use all capital letters. </li>
</ul>

<p>The use of typewritten, handwritten or a printed PowerPointTM presentation as a poster is unacceptable. Presentations in these formats will be removed. </p>


<ul>
<li>Be consistent.</li>
<li> Keep consistent margins.</li>
<li> Keep line spacing consistent.</li>
<li>Keep the color, style, and thickness of borders the same.</li>
<li>Keep shading consistent.</li>
<li>Pick no more than 2–3 fonts</li>
<li> Pick no more than 2–3 colors</li>
<li>Test readability</li>
<li>Title banner should be legible from 20 feet away.</li>
<li>Body text should legible from 6 feet away</li>
</ul>
